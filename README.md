Existing Logins if you want to check quickly for different roles:

Admin -
Username | Admin
Password | 123

Department Head -
Username | DepartmentHead
Password | 123

Employee -
Username | Employee
Password | 123

Client -
Username | Client
Password | 123

Demo:
First sign up and create an account using any username and password. Each account is initialized to the 'client' role, which can be changed by Admins or Department Heads which we will see later. As a client, you can only send a message to the Admins or Department Heads to send your username and the project details you want to submit to the company. The next is employee (for employee, department heads/admins can add an employee through their dashboard and will change the role for the user, and admins can directly change any user to any role). Employees can see all the departments in the company, the ongoing projects, and the ongoing tasks for each project. Department Heads can see the requests that the clients give, keep track of all the clients (add clients with active projects in the client page), see all the employees and assign employee roles, view the triggers that the app sends, and tracks the hours each employee works on each project. They also have access to the reports section of our app, viewing the top employees, project information (pulled from multiple tables), and task information. More information will be found in the Google drive folder
